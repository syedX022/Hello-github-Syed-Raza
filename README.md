# Hello-github-Syed-Raza
# Hi! I'm a beginner exploring the world of coding with a focus on data analysis and automation. I'm excited to learn how to use tools like Python, Pandas, and NumPy to work with real-world dataâ€”especially in areas like sales, retail, or customer behavior. My goal is to build practical skills that help turn raw data into smart decisions.
